Run the following command on root folder:
> python -m test.test_singlylinkedlist.py


# Description
## Singly Linked List
Singly Linked List is a linear data structure that connects nodes using a reference. Nodes are chained together sequentially by holding a reference to the node that was connected previously.
In this implementation, there are operations like search, insert, insert at position, delete occurances, size and more.

## Binary Tree
Binary tree is a tree-like data structure that connects a parent node to at most two children nodes. This type of data structure is great for searching and sorting. 
In this implementation, there are operations like print pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

## Graph
Graph is a non-linear data structure with nodes (vertices) and edges. Unlike a binary tree there is no root node that is hierarchical. Graphs have vertices that are interconnected to each other that can be cycled.
